This is a small project that I made so that I familiarize myself with React and its ecosystem. It has a simple CRUD
functionality and an authentication system so that users can register and login. To add some flavor to it
I also created the animation of an algorithm that uses a Min Heap to find the biggest items of an array.<br/>

<img src="/web_client_devias_pro/public/static/minHeap_forever.gif" alt="MinHeap animation" width="500px">

I had a lot of fun playing with react and d3 to create the animation, so I will probably create more animations
in the future with the Gradient Descent algorithm being a very good candidate...<br/>

I have used redux to store global state and the Devias Kit for the layout (it uses the Material UI components library).
The back end is a simple API built with the django rest framework.
